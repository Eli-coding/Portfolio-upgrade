    <p>Web Developer with a background in Customer Service. Recognized as a proactive, persistent problem-solver, resourceful, collaborative, <br/>
      and as well, excellent communicator with practical client relationship-building skills. I acquired a certificate in Full-Stack Development<br/>
      from the Penn LPS Coding Boot Camp. I developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React, MySQL, and third-party APIs in Bootcamp. <br/>
      I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. I have worked on a team on many occasions to develop viable<br/>
      full-stack applications in only two weeks. As a team, we created an easy-to-navigate and intuitive user experience. It brings me <br/>
      joy to create alongside a team a user interface that is clean, polished, and easy to navigate. </p>
