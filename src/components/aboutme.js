    <p> Web Developer with a background in Customer Service. Recognized as a proactive, persistent problem-solver, resourceful,<br/>
      collaborative, and as well, excellent communicator with practical client relationship-building skills. I acquired a<br/>
      certificate in Full-Stack Development from the Penn LPS Coding Boot Camp. I developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React,<br/>
      MySQL, and third-party APIs in Bootcamp. I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. I have <br/>
      worked on a team on many occasions to develop viable full-stack applications in only two weeks. As a team, we created an <br/>
      easy-to-navigate and intuitive user experience. It brings me joy to create alongside a team a user interface that is clean,<br/>
      polished, and easy to navigate. </p>
